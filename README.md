# Yabbi

Yabbi is a biometrics tool for data visualisation and better rehabilitation. The Yabbi visualisation was developed over a weekend for Health Hack 2018.

The software allows a user to visualise biometric data, with 3 dimensional and time-series components. Within the data, the client can look for excessive strain on the ligament.

It is possible for the client to visualise data which is stored in a remote location. In this case, the data to be visualised can be served across a network.
